This is my Final Project for Python 1 at DMACC
This program is a Life Insurance Calculator.  Financial Advisors can use this at a client meeting to help them calculate the life insurance need for their client.  I would suggest that
the advisor explain the steps so they are understood by the client. The advisor can add value to the conversation by explaining the steps.   It is calculating the income missing if one dies prematurely.  It is determining the income that needs to be
generated and how much capital is needed, invested at 5% can generate that income without using the principal.  It considers the existing assets, investments, retirement
savings that can also be used to fill that need.  It gives the client a choice whether they want to consider college costs for their children.  They may want to consider half the cost
or another percentage, not all parents want, or can, cover all the costs of college for their children. If no additional need it says that otherwise it tells them how
much more life insurance they need.
